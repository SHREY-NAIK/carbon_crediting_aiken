## What is a Carbon Credit?
A carbon credit represents the right to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO₂) or an equivalent amount of other greenhouse gases (e.g., methane, nitrous oxide).

Credits are generated by projects that reduce or remove emissions, such as renewable energy installations, reforestation, or energy efficiency initiatives.

## How Does Carbon Crediting Work?
Emitters: Companies or organizations that produce GHG emissions can purchase carbon credits to offset their emissions. This helps them meet regulatory requirements, corporate sustainability goals, or achieve carbon neutrality.

Projects: Carbon credits are generated by projects that either:

Avoid emissions (e.g., building wind farms instead of coal plants).

Remove emissions (e.g., planting trees that absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere).

Implementing carbon crediting using blockchain technology can enhance transparency, traceability, and efficiency in carbon markets. Blockchain's decentralized and immutable nature makes it well-suited for addressing challenges like double counting, fraud, and lack of trust in traditional carbon credit systems.

## Benefits of Blockchain in Carbon Crediting
Transparency: All transactions and credit details are publicly accessible on the blockchain.

Traceability: Each carbon token can be traced back to its origin, ensuring authenticity.

Efficiency: Smart contracts automate processes, reducing administrative costs and delays.

Security: Blockchain's immutability prevents fraud and tampering.

Global Accessibility: A decentralized system allows participants from anywhere in the world to trade carbon credits.


## Concept of this project:


## Registry validator :                          
  
A registry system on the Blockchain to record the essential information
for the following stakeholders: (a) Verifiers: They validate carbon credits from credit holders.
They also verify that carbon tokens burnt are equivalent to burning a proportionate amount of
emissions. (b) Credit-holders: They are organizations that already hold carbon credits in the
emissions trading ecosystem. (c) Customers: They are individuals and companies interested in
offsetting their carbon footprint by buying carbon credits and burning the carbon token.
These Individuals will be registered one by one by creating locking transactions on a contract address.




## Digital Token Validator :

A smart contract to mint digital tokens called carbon tokens based on
studied and approved carbon credits through a series of functions: (a) Approve credits entered by
the credit-holders, which is certified by the verifiers, (b) Mint the Carbon token, (c) Make the
Carbon token transferrable and burnable, (d) Burn offset carbon tokens, (e) Mint non-fungible
tokens as a badge of successful burning carbon tokens, representing offsetting carbon emissions.
Only credit_holders(green projects) can mint carbon_tokens
The carbon_token minting transaction will consume the already existing registry utxo and create 
a new entry with the same datum and carbon_token locked.
The customers can now purchase these tokens using the spend validator, where the credit_holder utxo will be updated
by sending the carbon_token from it to the customers address while the customer will have to send funds to the
credit_holders wallet , all this will be verified by the verifier whos signature will be required to sign 
the transaction.
Finally the customers can burn their tokens if they reduce their emissions and theyll get a carbonnft nft in return !
